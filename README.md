# Suppy-Demand-Gap-Analysis

Driver cancellations and non availability of cars are common problems faced by "ride hailing" app users. The aim of this analysis is to identify the root cause of the problem and recommend ways to improve the situation. 

Hypothetical airport-to-city/city-to-airport cab request data of 300 drivers over a five day period has been used for this analysis

Data description:
1. Request id: an unique identifier of the cab request
2. Time of request: date and time at which the request was made
3. Drop-off time: The drop-off date and time, in case the trip was completed 
4. Pick-up point: The point from which the request was made
5. Driver id: The unique identification number of the driver
6. Status of the request: The final status of the trip, that can be either completed, cancelled by the driver or no cars available
